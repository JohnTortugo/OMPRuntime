The differences of this version for version 0.1 are:

	- Improved dependence checker algorithm. Now the algorithm takes into consideration the
	access mode of the tasks.
	
	- The task alloc function now has a fixed size buffer for allocating tasks. This buffer
	is just a matrix of [NSLOTS] rows of [MAX_SLOT_SIZE] size. So whenever a task allocation 
	is requested data is taken from this buffer and no std malloc is necessary. If the size 
	of the requested allocation is larger than [MAX_SLOT_SIZE] a fallback call to std malloc
	is done.
