The differences of this version for version 0.4 and 0.5 are:

	- The task graph may be arbitrarily large.
	- The runtime steal tasks.
	
	This is (will) not (be) implemented because it is only useful when we have multiple run queues and it seems
	to me right now that we don't need to have multiple run queues.
		- The runtime and the control thread uses an improved work stealing approach.
