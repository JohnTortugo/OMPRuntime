The differences of this version for version 0.2 are:

	
	Errors:
	
		- A deadlock condition was possible in the code for barrier in the worker threads.
		The check of the threadWait and inFlightTask number was inverted...

	Load balancing:
	
		- Each worker thread has its own local run queue and the runtime scheduler
		distribute work in a ciclic way.
